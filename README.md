# Brief 1: Website Modification

## Overview
This project was created for **Brief 1** of the academic year, where the task was to modify a pre-made website template and add my unique touch to it. Below are the details of the changes and features I implemented.

## Modifications Made

### 1. Fragment Redirection
I started by taking various fragments from the index page and redirecting them to their own dedicated pages. I also removed the corresponding sections from the index page. The fragments I worked on include:

- **Portfolio**: Moved the portfolio fragment to its own page and gave it a unique background to differentiate it from other sections.
- **Services**: Similar to the portfolio, the services fragment was relocated to its own page, complete with a custom background.
- **Blog**: This section was also placed on its own page with its own background for consistency.
- **Contact**: I created a separate contact page with a distinct background, and I added two new input fields: "First Name" and "Last Name" for additional contact information.

### 2. Additional Features
As a bonus, I added an extra page and a logo to further enhance the project:

- **SignUp Page**: I created this page from scratch while retaining the site's header and footer for consistency. The body of the page includes simple form inputs to collect user data for a potential database. I used a color palette that matches the existing site theme.
- **Custom Logo**: I designed a unique logo that complements the overall theme of the website.

## Final Thoughts
This project was a great exercise in customizing and extending a template, and I hope my modifications meet the expectations of the brief. Thank you for reviewing my work!
